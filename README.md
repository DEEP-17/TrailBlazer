### 🧠 Algorithm Implementation Details

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm Breakdown

```javascript
Data Structures Used:
- Map<Node, Number> distances    // Distance from start to each node
- Map<Node, Node> previous       // Previous node in optimal path
- Set<Node> unvisited           // Nodes not yet processed

Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V)
Space Complexity: O(V)
Where V = vertices (nodes), E = edges
```

#### Graph Creation Process

```javascript
Input: Array of [latitude, longitude] coordinates
Process:
1. Convert coordinates to node objects
2. Calculate Haversine distances between consecutive nodes
3. Create bidirectional edges with distance weights
4. Build adjacency list representation

Output: {nodes: Array, edges: Map}
```

#### Haversine Distance Formula

```javascript
Purpose: Calculate great-circle distance between two points on Earth
Formula: 
  a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos φ1 ⋅ cos φ2 ⋅ sin²(Δλ/2)
  c = 2 ⋅ atan2(√a, √(1−a))
  d = R ⋅ c

Where:
  φ = latitude in radians
  λ = longitude in radians
  R = Earth's radius (6,371 km)
  Δ = difference between coordinates
```

```

## 🔧 Advanced Customization Guide

### 🎨 Theme Customization

#### Adding New Themes
```css
/* Add to styles.css */
[data-theme="custom"] {
  --bg-primary: #your-color;
  --text-primary: #your-color;
  --primary: #your-accent-color;
  /* ... other variables */
}
```

#### Custom Map Tiles
```javascript
// Add to updateMapTiles() function in script.js
if (currentTheme === 'custom') {
    currentTileLayer = L.tileLayer('https://your-tile-server/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
        attribution: 'Your Attribution'
    }).addTo(map);
}
```

### 🗺️ Map Customization

#### Custom Marker Styles
```javascript
// Modify createCustomIcon() function
function createCustomIcon(type) {
    const styles = {
        start: { color: '#your-color', icon: '🏁' },
        end: { color: '#your-color', icon: '🎯' },
        waypoint: { color: '#your-color', icon: '📍' }
    };
    // Implementation...
}
```

#### Additional Map Controls
```javascript
// Add custom controls to map
const customControl = L.control({position: 'topright'});
customControl.onAdd = function(map) {
    const div = L.DomUtil.create('div', 'custom-control');
    div.innerHTML = '<button>Custom Action</button>';
    return div;
};
customControl.addTo(map);
```

### 🧠 Algorithm Extensions

#### Adding New Pathfinding Algorithms
```javascript
// Add to pathfinding.js
async bellmanFord(startNode, endNode, nodes, edges) {
    // Implementation for Bellman-Ford algorithm
    // Handles negative edge weights
    // Time complexity: O(VE)
}

async floydWarshall(nodes, edges) {
    // Implementation for Floyd-Warshall algorithm
    // All-pairs shortest path
    // Time complexity: O(V³)
}
```

#### Custom Heuristic Functions
```javascript
// For future A* implementation
function manhattanDistance(node1, node2) {
    return Math.abs(node1.x - node2.x) + Math.abs(node1.y - node2.y);
}

function euclideanDistance(node1, node2) {
    return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(node1.x - node2.x, 2) + Math.pow(node1.y - node2.y, 2));
}
```
